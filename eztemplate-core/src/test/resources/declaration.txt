A Declaration by ${the} Representatives
of ${the} UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, in
General Congress assembled.

WHEN in ${the} Course of human Events it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve ${the} Political Bands which have connected ${the}m with ano${the}r, and to assume among ${the} Powers of ${the} Earth ${the} separate & equal Station to which ${the} Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle ${the}m, a decent Respect to ${the} Opinions of Mankind requires that ${the}y should declare ${the} causes which impel ${the}m to ${the} Separation.

WE hold ${the}se Truths to be self-evident: that all Men are created equal; that ${the}y are endowed by ${the}ir creator with inherent and* [certain] inalienable rights; that among ${the}se are life, liberty, & ${the} pursuit of happiness: that to secure ${the}se rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving ${the}ir just powers from ${the} consent of ${the} governed; that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of ${the}se ends, it is ${the} right of ${the} people to alter or abolish it, & to institute new government, laying it's foundation on such principles, & organizing it's powers in such form, as to ${the}m shall seem most likely to effect ${the}ir safety & happiness. Prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light & transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right ${the}mselves by abolishing ${the} forms to which ${the}y are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses & usurpations begun at a distinguished period and pursuing invariably ${the} same object, evinces a design to reduce ${the}m under absolute despotism, it is ${the}ir right, it is ${the}ir duty to throw off such government, & to provide new guards for ${the}ir future security. Such ${has} been ${the} patient sufferance of ${the}se colonies; & such is now ${the} necessity which constrains ${the}m to expunge [alter] ${the}ir former systems of government. ${the} history of ${the} present king of Great Britain is a history of unremitting [repeated] injuries & usurpations, among which appears no solitary fact to contradict ${the} uniform tenor of ${the} rest but all have [all having]in direct object ${the} establishment of an absolute tyranny over ${the}se states. To prove this let facts be submitted to a candid world for ${the} truth of which we pledge a faith yet unsullied by falsehood.

HE ${has} refused his assent to laws ${the} most wholesome & necessary for ${the} public good.

HE ${has} ${forbidden} his governors to pass laws of immediate & pressing importance, unless suspended in ${the}ir operation till his assent should be obtained; & when so suspended, he ${has} utterly neglected to attend to ${the}m.

HE ${has} refused to pass o${the}r laws for ${the} accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish ${the} right of representation in ${the} legislature, a right inestimable to ${the}m, & formidable to tyrants only.

HE ${has} called toge${the}r legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from ${the} depository of ${the}ir public records, for ${the} sole purpose of fatiguing ${the}m into compliance with his measures.

HE ${has} dissolved representative houses repeatedly & continually for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on ${the} rights of ${the} people.

HE ${has} refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause o${the}rs to be elected, whereby ${the} legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to ${the} people at large for ${the}ir exercise, ${the} state remaining in ${the} meantime exposed to all ${the} dangers of invasion from without & convulsions within.

HE ${has} endeavored to prevent ${the} population of ${the}se states; for that purpose obstructing ${the} laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass o${the}rs to encourage ${the}ir migrations hi${the}r, & raising ${the} conditions of new appropriations of lands.

HE ${has} suffered [obstructed] ${the} administration of justice totally to cease in some of ${the}se states [by] refusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.

HE ${has} made our judges dependant on his will alone, for ${the} tenure of ${the}ir offices, & ${the} amount & paiment of ${the}ir salaries.

HE ${has} erected a multitude of new offices by a self assumed power and sent hi${the}r swarms of new officers to harass our people and eat out ${the}ir substance.

HE ${has} kept among us in times of peace standing armies and ships of war without ${the} consent of our legislatures.

HE ${has} affected to render ${the} military independent of, & superior to ${the} civil power.

HE ${has} combined with o${the}rs to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions & unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to ${the}ir acts of pretended legislation:

FOR quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

FOR protecting ${the}m by a mock-trial from punishment for any murders which ${the}y should commit on ${the} inhabitants of ${the}se states

FOR cutting off our trade with all parts of ${the} world:

FOR imposing taxes on us without our consent:

FOR depriving us [in many cases] of ${the} benefits of trial by jury

FOR transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences:

FOR abolishing ${the} free system of English laws in a neighboring province, establishing ${the}rein an arbitrary government, and enlarging it's boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing ${${the}} same absolute rule into ${the}se states [colonies]:

FOR taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering fundamentally ${the} forms of our governments:

FOR suspending our own legislatures, & declaring ${the}mselves invested with ${power} to legislate for us in allcases whatsoever.

He ${has} abdicated government here withdrawing his governors, and declaring us out of his allegiance & protection. [by declaring us out of his protection and waging war against us.]

He ${has} plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, & destroyed ${the} lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to compleat ${the} works of death, desolation & tyranny already begun with circumstanccs of cruelty and perfidy [scarcely paralleled in ${the} most barbarous ages, & totally] unworthy ${the} head of a civilized nation.

He ${has} constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on ${the} high seas to bear arms against ${the}ir country, to become ${the} executioners of ${the}ir friends & brethren, or to fall ${the}mselves by ${the}ir hands.

He ${has} [excited domestic insurection among us, & ${has}] endeavored to bring on ${the} inhabitants of our frontiers ${the} merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, & conditions of existence.

He ${has} incited treasonable insurrections of our fellow-citizens, with ${the} allurements of forfeiture & confiscation of our property.

He ${has} waged cruel war against human nature itself, violating it's most sacred rights of life and liberty in ${the} persons of a distant people who never offended him, captivating & carrying ${the}m into slavery in ano${the}r hemisphere, or to incur miserable death in ${the}ir transportation thi${the}r. This piratical warfare, ${the} opprobium of INFIDEL Powers, is ${the} warfare of ${the} CHRISTIAN king of Great Britain. Determined to keep open a market where MEN should be bought & sold, he ${has} prostituted his negative for suppressing every legislative attempt to prohibit or to restrain this execrable commerce. And that this assemblage of horrors might want no fact of distinguished die, he is now exciting those very people to rise in arms among us, and to purc${has}e that liberty of which he ${has} deprived ${the}m, by murdering ${the} people on whom he also obtruded ${the}m: thus paying off former crimes committed against ${the} LIBERTIES of one people, with crimes which he urges ${the}m to commit against ${the} LIVES of ano${the}r.

In every stage of ${the}se oppressions we have petitioned for redress in ${the} most humble terms: our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injuries.

A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be ${the} ruler of a [free] people who mean to be free. Future ages will scarcely believe that ${the} hardiness of one man adventured, within ${the} short compass of twelve years only, to lay a foundation so broad & so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered & fixed in principles of freedom.

Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned ${the}m from time to time of attempts by ${the}ir legislature to extend a [an unwarrantable] jurisdiction over ${the}se our states [us]. We have reminded ${the}m of ${the} circumstances of our emigration & settlement here, no one of which could warrant so strange a pretension: that ${the}se were effected at ${the} expense of our own blood & treasure, unassisted by ${the} wealth or ${the} strength of Great Britain: that in constituting indeed our several forms of government, we had adopted one common king, ${the}reby laying a foundation for perpetual league & amity with ${the}m: but that submission to ${the}ir parliament was no part of our constitution, nor ever in idea, if history may be credited: and, we [have] appealed to ${the}ir native justice and magnanimity [and we have conjured ${the}m by] as well as to ${the} ties of our common kindred to disavow ${the}se usurpations which were likely to [would inevitably] interrupt our connection and correspondence. ${the}y too have been deaf to ${the} voice of justice & of consanguinity, and when occasions have been given ${the}m, by ${the} regular course of ${the}ir laws, of removing from ${the}ir councils ${the} disturbers of our harmony, ${the}y have, by ${the}ir free election, re-established ${the}m in power. At this very time too ${the}y are permitting ${the}ir chief magistrate to send over not only soldiers of our common blood, but Scotch & foreign mercenaries to invade & destroy us. ${the}se facts have given ${the} last stab to agonizing affection, and manly spirit bids us to renounce forever ${the}se unfeeling brethren. We must endeavor to forget our former love for ${the}m, and hold ${the}m as we hold ${the} rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. We might have been a free and a great people toge${the}r; but a communication of grandeur & of freedom it seems is below ${the}ir dignity. Be it so, since ${the}y will have it. ${the} road to happiness & to glory is open to us too. We will tread it apart from ${the}m, and [We must ${the}refore] acquiesce in ${the} necessity which denounces our eternal separation! [and hold ${the}m as we hold ${the} rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.]

We ${the}refore ${the} representatives of ${the} united States of America in General Congress assebled [appealing to ${the} Judge of ${the} World for ${the} recititude of our intentions] do in ${the} name & by authority of ${the} good people of ${the}se states [colonies] reject and renounce all allegiance & subjections to ${the} kings of Great Britain & all o${the}rs who may hereafter claim by, through or under ${the}m: we utterly disolve all political connection which may heretofore have subsisted between us & ${the} people or parliment of Great Britain: and finally we do assert and declare ${the}se colonies to be free and independent states, [solemly Publish and Declare that ${the}se United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be, Free and Independent States; that ${the}y are dissolved from allegiance to ${the} British Crown, and that all political Connection between ${the}m and ${the} State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved;] and that as free and independent states, ${the}y have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract allies, establish commerce, & do all o${the}r acts & things which independent states may of right do.

And for ${the} support of this declaration, [with a firm reliance on ${the} protection of divine providence] we mutually pledge to each o${the}r our lives, our fortunes, & our sacred honor.
